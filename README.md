# MemoryBoundComputations

Here you can find the materials for the Memory Bound Computations tutorial.

For doing your exercises, I suggest to use a machine with as much cores as possible.  2 cores is a bit small for the tutorial (but acceptable),
and between 4 and 8 is an ideal number.

Just go the your machine (your laptop or a remote one) and clone the repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/FrancescAlted/MemoryBoundComputations
```

Also, make sure that you have the next Python packages installed:

* numpy
* numexpr
* numba
* bcolz
* matplotlib

I recommend to use Anaconda to install most of the packages above, and for
the software there that is not in the latest version (e.g. bcolz), use:

```
$ pip install bcolz
```

After that, just start the exercises by following the [guidelines](https://github.com/FrancescAlted/MemoryBoundComputations/blob/master/exercises/guidelines.rst).  We will be having a dicussion of your results amid you are getting them.

** Enjoy Data! **
